# Smart File Organizer

A Python-based desktop and CLI tool that automatically organizes files by extension and filename patterns. It includes a GUI (Tkinter) and a safe copy-only mode to ensure original files remain untouched.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Organizes files by extension (images, documents, code, etc.)
- Groups files by similar filename patterns
- GUI version using Tkinter
- CLI version for terminal usage
- Safe copy-only mode (no deletion or movement)
- Handles duplicate filenames automatically
- Progress tracking and live logging

---

## 📂 How It Works

The tool scans a source directory and:

1. Detects file type by extension  
2. Extracts meaningful patterns from filenames  
3. Creates categorized folders  
4. Copies files into structured directories
